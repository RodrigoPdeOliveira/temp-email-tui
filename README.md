# Text-based User Interface for temporary email

#### A interface to quickly create temporary email addresses on demand using the [API of 1secMAIL](https://www.1secmail.com/api/)

What can it do right now:

 - Create a new random email address
 - Check the mailbox of the current address
 - Check any mail on the mailbox

What I might add later:

 - Attachment download
 - A interface that works intuitively, unlike the current one
 - No idea ¯\ _ (ツ)_/¯
